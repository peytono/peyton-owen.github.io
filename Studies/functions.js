/**
 *  FUNCTIONS:
 *  0.
 *  1. A function has two phases, declaration and invocation.
 *  2. Paramaters vs. Arguments
 *  3. Syntax for a named function
 *  4. Assigning a function to a variable
 *  5. Specififying inputs and outputs, they can also be used optionally
 *  6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes, but they cannot access inner scopes.
 *  7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and is referenced, that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures.
