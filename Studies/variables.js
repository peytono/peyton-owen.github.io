/**
 *  VARIABLES: 
 * 0. To hold things in memory during the life-cycle of a program we can use variables. Variables are named identifies that can point to values of a particular type, like a Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object or another data-type. Variables are called so because once created, we can CHANGE the value (and type of a value) to which they point.
 * 1. Declaration and assignment: To create a variable in JavaScript we must first DECLARE it using one of three declaritive keywords. Assignment is the first time a variable is given or 'assigned' a value.
 * 2. Var, let, const: var, let and const are the three declarative keywords. The three keywords have different uses. They differ in rules when it comes to initialization, redeclaring, reassigning, and scope. 
 * 3. Hoisting: The process by which your program can move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the beginning or their scope, before executing code.

// 1. Declaration and Assignment //

// Declaration 
// At the declaration phase either var, let, or const should be used to declare the variable. Following the key word a space should be used, followed by a name that has correlation
var age; 

// Assignment
// age is now assigned the number 35 as its value
age = 35;


// 2. Var, let and const //

// var //
